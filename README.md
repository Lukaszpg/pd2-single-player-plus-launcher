## Prerequisites

Requirements:

- **CLEAN** installation of **Project Diablo 2** is required.
  
**As of now this launcher is for WINDOWS OS only. I will work on making this available on other operating systems.**

## Installation

## How to install

a) With PlugY:

1. Copy your Diablo 2 game with Project Diablo 2 mod installed to a new directory.
2. Install PD2 Plugy for SP in your `ProjectD2` folder in your Diablo2 directory by BetweenWalls: https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-PlugY#pd2-plugy.

   **WARNING - The materials tab introduced in season 11 will not work with Plugy!**
   
	2a. If you already have Plugy installed and played previous versions of this mod, please remove the contents of shared stash and create a new character.
3. Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Lukaszpg/pd2-single-player-plus-launcher) of PD2 Single Player+ launcher.
4. Install the launcher downloaded in step 3 in the `ProjectD2` folder in your Diablo 2 directory.
6. Run `PD2 Single Player+ Launcher.exe` as Administrator.
7. **IMPORTANT!** Click settings in the launcher in the top left corner and check the `Play with PlugY` checkbox. Adjust the path where do you want your single player characters and stash to be stored.
8. Save the settings. Click play button.
9. Head to Akara and look for an item with Alkor's quest potion graphics. If it's there, mod was installed successfully. GLHF!

## Troubleshooting

1. I have launched the mod through PlugY exe, but it's not working with an error pictured below.

**Solution:** Open PlugY.ini file in your ProjectD2 directory, look for `ActiveShiftClickLimit=1` and change it to `ActiveShiftClickLimit=0`. 

2. The launcher seems to be stuck on "Updating..." and the Play button is unavailable.

**Solution:** Launch the `PD2 Single Player+ Launcher.exe` as admin. Make sure that anti-virus or firewall software is not blocking the connections.
